# Automatic Spell Checker in Bengali

Welcome to the **Automatic Spell Checker in Bengali**! This web application is designed to automatically identify and correct spelling mistakes in Bengali text as you type. Built with Flask, this app leverages advanced algorithms and a trained vocabulary model to detect and suggest corrections for misspelled Bengali words.

## Features

- **Real-time Spelling Correction**: As you type, the app detects the last word you typed and automatically corrects it if a spelling mistake is found.
- **Interactive User Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction with the spell checker.
- **Bengali Character Support**: The spell checker is specifically trained to work with Bengali characters, ensuring accurate spelling suggestions.
- **Misspelled Words Counter**: A count of the total misspelled words detected and corrected during your session.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Spelling Correction Algorithm**: Levenshtein Distance, Edit Operations, Word Probability Models
- **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript (jQuery)
- **Data**: Pre-trained vocabulary and word probabilities in Bengali

## How It Works

### Backend

- **SpellChecker Class**: This class implements various operations (insert, delete, swap, replace) to generate spelling correction suggestions based on the Levenshtein distance. It uses a trained vocabulary and word probabilities stored in pickle files.
- **Flask Server**: The backend is powered by Flask. It exposes two routes:
  - `/correct_spelling`: Takes user input as JSON, processes the text using the `SpellChecker`, and returns the corrected text.
  - `/`: Displays the frontend HTML page.

### Frontend

- **Textarea Input**: Users type Bengali text in the textarea provided.
- **Real-Time Spell Checking**: The app constantly monitors your text input and suggests corrections when you type.
- **Misspelled Word Counter**: It tracks and displays the number of corrected words in real time.

#### Acknowledgments

This project uses the **Levenshtein distance** algorithm and **edit operations** (insert, delete, swap, and replace) for detecting and correcting spelling errors. The word probability model is based on a custom-trained dataset for Bengali words.
